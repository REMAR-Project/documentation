# documentation
A repository for REMAR project-wide documentation.


## Why?
The current project is spread across a number of repositories that hold the sourcecode and related artefacts for a whole bunch of development. However, until now there was no place that could hold project-wide documentatation and related, useful, stuff like getting started guides for our developers.
